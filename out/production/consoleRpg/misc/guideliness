console RPG idea.

Character creation
name
races
classes
stats depend on race and class.
HP / MP / ATTACK / DEFENSE / XP / gender

character selection
character saving and loading functionality
save/load to, from file.

the in-game menu (should be comprehensive, with clear instructions, maybe with interface), with ability to select:
your own profile / stats
location where to go (basically, menu selection of locations)
help command list
additional actions / items / skills


Fighting mechanics
battle with monsters
monster stats
monster quantity until boss is found
drop from monsters / bosses
experience gain

Death mechanic, what happens when you die





further ideas:
game story :
quests, background, bosses, GUI. Later create save to/from db.




who does what?
